### Problem #43: Unique Value Filter with a Set

---

### What This Problem Test:

**Problem #43**:

-   Understanding of Sets and their ability to handle unique values.
-   Ability to work with basic array transformations.

---

Write a function called `filterUnique` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the unique values from the input array. Use a **Set** to achieve this functionality.

**Requirements**:

1. Use the `Set` class to filter out duplicate values.
2. Ensure the function maintains the original order of the unique values as they appear in the input array.

**Example**:

```javascript
const input = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
console.log(filterUnique(input)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
