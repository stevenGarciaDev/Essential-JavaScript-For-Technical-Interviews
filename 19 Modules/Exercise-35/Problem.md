### Problem #34: Implement and Use Named and Default Exports

---

### What This Problem Test:

**Problem #34**:

-   Understanding the difference between named and default exports.
-   Ability to correctly import and use multiple types of exports.

---

Create two JavaScript files:

1. **`mathOperations.js`**:

    - Export a default function called `add` that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
    - Export a named function called `multiply` that takes two numbers and returns their product.

2. **`main.js`**:
    - Import both the default and named exports from `mathOperations.js`.
    - Use both functions to calculate and log the results of:
        - Adding 10 and 5.
        - Multiplying 10 and 5.

**Requirements**:

-   Ensure proper use of named and default exports.
-   Show how to handle multiple imports in `main.js`.

**Expected Results**:

Running `main.js` should log:

```
Addition result: 15
Multiplication result: 50
```
