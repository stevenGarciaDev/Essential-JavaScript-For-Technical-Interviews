Write a function called `manageObject` that performs the following tasks:

1. Create an object called `user` with the properties:
    - `name`: `"John"`
    - `age`: `30`
2. Add a new property `email` with the value `"john@example.com"`.
3. Update the `age` property to `31`.
4. Delete the `email` property.
5. Return the final state of the object.

```javascript
{
  name: "John",
  age: 31
}
```
