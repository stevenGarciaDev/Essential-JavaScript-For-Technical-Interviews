### **Problem #11: Working with Arrow Functions, Destructuring, and Spread**

---

### **What This Problem Test:**

**Problem #11:**  
 Tests understanding of destructuring, arrow functions, and the spread operator in practical array manipulation.

---

Write a function called `processArray` that performs the following tasks:

1. Accepts an array of numbers as input.
2. Uses **destructuring** to extract the first number into a variable called `first` and the rest of the numbers into an array called `remaining`.
3. Uses an **arrow function** to multiply each number in the `remaining` array by 2.
4. Combines `first` (unchanged) and the doubled values from `remaining` into a new array using the **spread operator**.
5. Returns the new array.

**Example Input:**

```javascript
processArray([1, 2, 3, 4]);
```

**Expected Output:**

```javascript
[1, 4, 6, 8];
```
