### **Problem #6: Filtering and Transforming Arrays**

---

### **What This Problem Test:**

**Problem #6:**  
 Tests intermediate array operations, focusing on `filter()` and `map()` for transforming data, as well as chaining methods for a clean solution.

---

Create a function called `processNumbers` that takes an array of numbers as input and performs the following tasks:

1. Use the `filter()` method to remove all numbers less than 10.
2. Use the `map()` method to multiply the remaining numbers by 2.
3. Return the new transformed array.

**Example Input:**

```javascript
const inputArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];
```

**Expected Output:**

```javascript
// After filtering and transforming, the result should be:
[20, 30, 40, 50];
```
