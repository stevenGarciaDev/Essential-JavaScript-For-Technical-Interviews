### **Problem #5: Array Manipulation**

---

### **What This Problem Test:**

**Problem #5:**  
 Tests basic array manipulations, including adding, removing, and inserting elements, as well as checking for a value using `includes()`.

---

Write a function called `arrayOperations` that performs the following tasks:

1. Create an array called `fruits` with the values `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
2. Add `"orange"` to the end of the array.
3. Remove the first element from the array.
4. Insert `"grape"` at the second position.
5. Check if `"banana"` is still in the array using the `includes()` method.
6. Return the updated array.

**Expected Output:**

```javascript
// After performing all operations, the returned array should be:
["banana", "grape", "cherry", "orange"];
// And the check for "banana" should return true.
```
