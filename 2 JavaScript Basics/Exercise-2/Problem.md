### **Problem 2: Event-Driven and Functional Programming**

---

### **What This Problem Test:**

**Problem 2:** Tests understanding of: - Object-oriented programming (creating an object with methods). - Event-driven programming (simulating actions with `setTimeout`). - Console debugging (`console.log`).

---

Create a simple counter application using JavaScript. Your task is to:

1. Write an object called `counter` that has the following:
    - A property `count` initialized to 0.
    - A method `increment` that increases `count` by 1.
    - A method `decrement` that decreases `count` by 1.
    - A method `reset` that sets `count` back to 0.
2. Simulate user interaction by using `setTimeout` to call the methods in this sequence:
    - Increment the counter twice.
    - Decrement it once.
    - Reset the counter.

**Expected Output in the Console:**

```
Count after increment: 1
Count after increment: 2
Count after decrement: 1
Count after reset: 0
```
